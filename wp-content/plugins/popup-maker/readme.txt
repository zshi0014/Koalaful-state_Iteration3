== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are some ways popups can increase my WooCommerce store's sales and revenues? =
Many people don't consider popups when trying to find ways to increase conversion rates and revenue on their WooCommerce site but they are actually very effective.

Some popups we have seen work well for ecommerce sites include:

* Cross-sell popups - recommending a companion product when viewing or adding a product to their cart
* Upsell popups - recommending a higher-tier product when viewing or adding a product to their cart
* Cart abandonment popups - offering discounts or support when someone is about to leave the checkout page

= Where is your documentation? =
You can find our documentation over on [our docs site](https://docs.wppopupmaker.com?utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=readme-faqs&utm_content=documentation)

= How do I open a popup? =
Using "triggers", you can customize what makes each popup open. Review [our triggers documentation here](https://docs.wppopupmaker.com/article/141-triggers-cookies?utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=readme-faqs&utm_content=open-a-popup)

= How do I stop popups from opening repeatedly? =
Using "cookies", you can set up how long until the popup opens again, if ever. Review [our cookies documentation](https://docs.wppopupmaker.com/article/148-cookies?utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=readme-faqs&utm_content=stop-opening-repeatedly)

= What do I do if I want a popup to show only on a certain page/post/etc? =
Using "conditions", you can specify where the popup will be shown. Check out [our conditions documentation](https://docs.wppopupmaker.com/article/140-conditions?utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=readme-faqs&utm_content=target-certain-pages)

= How do I make it work with my 3rd party forms? =
Beginning with Popup Maker v1.7, we now support most forms by default. We do this by adding a hidden field using JavaScript to any form inserted in a popup. This field contains the popup ID.

When we detect that ID in PHP, we queue up that popup to reopen immediately after refresh to show errors or success messages.

= How do I take advantage of the success actions Popup Maker provides for 3rd party forms? =
We have built-in support for the most popular form plugins. But if we don't, then we have a few helper functions that allow you to take full advantage of our success actions and setting cookies.

This link contains AJAX (JavaScript) & Non-AJAX (PHP) based solutions which you can hack with your forms hooks & events. https://gist.github.com/danieliser/0060112b18b6013f2683653236b02439

= Why aren't my popups opening/working? =
There are several common causes for this, check [this guide for help](https://docs.wppopupmaker.com/article/265-my-popup-wont-work-how-can-i-fix-it?utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=readme-faqs&utm_content=popup-wont-open) resolving it.
