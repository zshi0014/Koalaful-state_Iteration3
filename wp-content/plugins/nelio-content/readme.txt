= Reasons for choosing Nelio =

Take a look at the top 6 reasons for choosing Nelio Content:

= #1. Editorial Calendar—All You Need, at a Glance =

The Editorial Calendar is one of the most powerful tools included in Nelio Content. It offers a unified view of absolutely all your content (that is, posts, social messages, and tasks). It’s also the easiest way to create new content and reschedule your posts and social messages, simply by dragging-and-dropping them.

= #2. Social Networks—Schedule and Promote Your Content Automatically =

Most social plugins will automatically share the title and permalink of your post when it’s published. Nelio Content goes one step further and **automatically generates multiple social publications** so that your post is effectively promoted on social media. With [Social Automations](http://neliosoftware.com/content/social-automations/), Nelio Content will extract the most relevant sentences of your copy and create a marketing strategy that will drive more visitors to your blog. Share your content easily on **Twitter**, **Facebook**, **LinkedIn**, **Tumblr**, **Instagram**, **Google My Business**, and **Pinterest**.

= #3. Analytics—Measure Your Performance =

Discover your best content and continue promoting it. Nelio Content integrates the relevant metrics from your Google Analytics and social media accounts and helps you to re-promote the content that works best.

= #4. Content Assistant—We Take Care of the Details =

Tagging content properly, using images to illustrate your ideas, linking old posts in your blog to build a strong internal link structure, or linking to other blogs to offer different views on a subject are all examples of how you can create beautiful content. Nelio Content analyzes the content of your posts and recommends the actions you may take to improve its quality.

= #5. Teams—You’ll Never Work Alone =

Nelio Content is a multi-user plugin that makes it easy to work with your team. The plugin offers the right tools to each user at each moment based on their context and WordPress role.

= #6. Advanced Functionalities—There’s More than You Think =

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need Nelio Content? =

If you publish content with WordPress, Nelio Content will save you work organizing everything in a more efficient way thanks to the integrated editorial calendar. In addition, you can promote your posts on social networks effortlessly and without leaving WordPress.

= What are Social Automations? =

Social Automations is the most powerful feature included in Nelio Content. After writing a new post, Nelio Content will automatically analyze its copy and extract the most relevant sentences to generate a set of messages that will be shared on your social media when the post is published and afterwards. This feature is way more powerful than basic Social Templates, because the generated messages are crafted using the unique content of the post being shared. Moreover, Nelio Content is even capable of mentioning other Twitter users in your tweets to maximize the chances of being retweeted and, therefore, reaching a broader audience.

= I’ve Connected my Social Profiles but Nelio Content Doesn’t Share Any Messages. Why? =

First of all, [make sure you’ve enabled Social Automations on one or more social accounts](https://neliosoftware.com/content/help/publication-and-reshare-automations/). Then, after you’ve written a new post, scroll down to the Social Media box and click on the _Create Social Messages Automatically_ button. This will generate a marketing timeline to promote your post on your social accounts when the post is published and afterwards. If you don’t create those messages, Nelio Content won’t publish anything. This solution allows you to review the content that will be automatically shared before it actually happens.

Keep in mind automations are only available to subscribers of Nelio Content Premium. If you’re using the free version of Nelio Content, only one message per profile and post will be shared upon post’s publication.

= Do I need a subscription to use Nelio Content? =

* **Bug Fix**. Fixes fatal error that showed in PHP 7.0.

= 2.0.1 (September 2, 2020) =
